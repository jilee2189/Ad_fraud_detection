How to Make the Most of These for Project 3

Start with EDA
Use the TalkingData EDA notebook to understand the nature of anomalies—like abnormal click distributions or time-based bursts—and replicate those insights in your own project.

Select a baseline approach
Build upon the Ad Fraud Baseline code for a robust starting point. That ensures your project is reproducible and structured.

Incorporate modern modeling practices
Leverage ideas from the recent Transaction Fraud Detection notebook. For example: feature engineering, class balancing, and model validation.

Extend with anomaly detection layers
Detect anomalies like unusual IP clusters or time-window spikes using statistical thresholds, clustering-based outlier detection, or autoencoders.

Wrap in an end-to-end pipeline
Finally, combine all this with your planned architecture: ETL → MLflow/Dagshub tracking → Dockerized model + CI/CD → AWS deployment + dashboards. This will showcase not just your modeling ability but also full production readiness.
